      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Clive Nyaga. I was born on May 7, 2003. My passion for technology, puzzles, and analysis drives my learning journey in both software engineering and data science. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me deep into football (playing or watching), immersed in country music, or enjoying documentaries about animals, psychology, health, fitness, finance, and history. My diverse interests fuel my creativity and curiosity in all aspects of life. I am also fluent in English, Spanish and Kiswahili.</p>

I am also pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at Kenyatta University, where I’ve built a strong foundation in networks, systems, and information management.</p>
